Collaborative filtering, also referred to as social filtering, filters information by using the recommendations of other people. Having an accurate algorithm can mean the difference between better automated predictions or hours of manual post-processing data. Collaborative filtering has two senses, a narrow one and a more general one.
So improving the standard of collaborative filtering approaches up to some extand can be tweaked for higher quality or faster prediction. This
flexibility makes it a good alternative in a wide range of practical
applications.
